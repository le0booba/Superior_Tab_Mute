## üåü Features

### üéØ Smart Muting Modes

-   **Active Tab Mode**: Only the currently active tab plays audio, perfect for focused browsing or work.
-   **First Sound Mode**: Prioritizes the first tab that plays audio, ideal for listening to music or podcasts in the background.
-   **Whitelist Mode**: Manually select a single tab to play audio, offering precise control for complex workflows.
-   **Mute New Tabs Mode**: Automatically mutes all newly opened tabs, keeping your session quiet by default.

### ‚ö° Instant Controls

-   **Master Toggle**: Enable or disable the extension with a single click or shortcut (`Alt+Shift+S`).

### üß† Intelligent Automation

This ensures seamless listening without manual intervention, intelligently prioritizing your listening experience.

## üîß Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Problem: The extension isn't muting any tabs.</strong></summary>
<blockquote>

- **Check the Master Toggle**: Ensure the main toggle switch (‚≠ò / ‚èΩ) in the popup is enabled (‚èΩ).
- **Check Global Mute**: Make sure the "Mute All Tabs" switch is not overriding your selected mode.
- **Reload the Extension**: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find Superior Tab Mute, and click the refresh icon.
- **Restart Chrome**: A simple restart can resolve temporary issues.

</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Problem: Keyboard shortcuts are not working.</strong></summary>
<blockquote>

- This is usually caused by a conflict with another extension or a Chrome internal shortcut.
- **Solution**: Navigate to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`. Find Superior Tab Mute and check if any of its shortcuts have a conflict warning. You can re-assign the shortcut to a different key combination on this page.

</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Problem: A specific tab is not behaving as expected.</strong></summary>
<blockquote>

- **Verify the Mode**: Double-check which mode is active. The behavior depends entirely on it.
- **Re-select the Source**: In "Whitelist" or "First Sound" mode, try re-selecting the desired tab from the list. In "First Sound" mode, you can also use the **üîä Current Tab ü†Ü SOURCE** button to force an update.
- **Reload the Tab**: The specific web page might be in an unusual state. Reloading the tab (F5 or Ctrl+R) often fixes this.

</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Problem: The popup interface seems frozen or isn't updating.</strong></summary>
<blockquote>

- **Re-open the Popup**: Simply click outside the popup to close it, then click the extension icon again.
- **Reload the Extension**: If re-opening doesn't work, a full reload of the extension from `chrome://extensions/` will reset its state.

</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Problem: The "Remember Last Source" feature isn't working.</strong></summary>
<blockquote>

- **Check the Toggle**: Make sure the "Remember last source" toggle is enabled for the current mode (First Sound or Whitelist).
- **Verify History**: The feature requires at least one other tab to have played audio recently. The extension maintains a history of up to 20 recently audible tabs.
- **Test It**: Close the current source tab and see if the extension switches to another recently audible tab automatically.
